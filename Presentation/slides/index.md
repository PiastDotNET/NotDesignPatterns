### <s>Design patterns</s>

---

### About working with Code

***

### Who am I?

***

### Agenda
 * Conventions
 * A word about architecture
 * Design patterns
 * SOLID
 * What else?
 * Q&A

***

### Conventions
 * Variables naming
 * Folders
 * Classes and Methods naming

***

### A word about architecture
 * What is it?
 * Whay should I care?

***

### Why do we need design patterns?
 * Helps us organize our code
 * Provides a proven solutions

*** 

### Good design patterns

---

### Repository pattern
 * Abstraction between database and service
 * Easy to use
 * Helpfull on every stage of work

---

### Factory
 * Provider for instances of other classes
 * EAsy to use

***

### Bad design patterns

---

### GOD object
 * One class does everything
 * Hard to maintain

---

### Singleton
 * One instance of object in whole program
 * Can cause unwanted troubles, e.g. deadlocks

***

### SOLID principles

---

### Single responsibility principle
Class should have one and only one responsibility

---


### Open/closed principle
Class should be opened to enlargement, but closed to modification

---

### Liskov substitution principle
Every children of a class should be able to replace it parent without any cause

--- 

### Interface segregation principle
Interfaces should be specialized

---

### Dependency inversion principle
Classes should be dependend on abstraction, no concrete implementation

***

### What else?

---

### KISS
####Keep it Sipmle, Stupid
 * More complex your code is, harder it will be to maintain it
 * Do not complicate anything!

---

### DRY
####Don't Repeat Youtself
 * If you use some login in more than one place, move it to some service
 * It's better to maintain one service than 3 same pieces of code whic you have to update

---

### YAGNI
####Yoou Aren't Gonna Need It
 * Do not write anything, because "maybe you will need it". You won't
 * Even if you will, I bet it will be outdated then
